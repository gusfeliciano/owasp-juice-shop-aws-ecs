# Challenge: Confidentail Document

The hint provided on what to do states: Somewhere in the application you can find a file that contains sensitive information about some - potentially hostile - takeovers the Juice Shop top management has planned.

If you scope around the website you find that the "About Us" page has a link that takes you to a lorem ipsum text block. 

The interested thing about this page is that the url ends in `:3000/ftp/legal.md`. 

You can remove the "legal.md" portion of the url and see if you can go directly to the ftp url.

In the ftp you will find a list of files and one is called "acquisitions.md" this will list a confidential list of competitors that the company has acquired.

And challenge completed!
