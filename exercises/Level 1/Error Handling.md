# Challange: Error Handling

Provoke an error that is neither very gracefully nor consistently handled

There are quite a few ways to get this challenge completed, my approach was to find a input form that would let me enter incorrect information. 

I ended up in the Deluxe Membership upgrade page and input random strings into the coupon code. Which produce an error int he console log and improper handling of an incorrect coupon code.
